    <center><p>Some people think that drawing is something only for people who are talented at it. Drawing is one of the best ways to express your creativity in my opinion and anyone can do it. You can express your emotions or simply use it as a relaxing technique, similiar to meditation or a breathing exercise. I used to draw when I was upset or needed to focus on something else at the moment. I enjoyed taking art classes and learning about different techniques. I love to visit art galleries and look at the varoius forms of art displayed. I am always wondering what the person was thinking or how they were feeling during the creative process.</p></center>
